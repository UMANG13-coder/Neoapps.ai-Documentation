            - Read: Access data through read endpoints for seamless retrieval.
            - Update: Modify existing records or entities through designated update endpoints.
            - Delete: Remove records or entities securely with dedicated delete endpoints.
    - **Relational APIs**:
        Establish relationships between entities, enhancing data connectivity.
    - **Reporting APIs**:
        Enable powerful reporting capabilities, allowing you to extract insights from your data.

2. **Use AI Template**
    > Neoapps.AI introduces an innovative approach to backend generation through AI Templates. While specific details are yet to be disclosed, refer to our roadmap for in-depth information on leveraging AI Templates for backend creation.
