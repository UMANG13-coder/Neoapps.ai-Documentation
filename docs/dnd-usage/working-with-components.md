# Working with Components

Components are the building blocks of your application in the NeoApps.AI. They allow you to add various functionalities and elements to your app, from basic text and images to more complex data tables and interactive forms.

## Adding a Component

To add a component to your app:

1. Navigate to the **Components** section in the left sidebar of the app builder interface.
2. Browse or search for the component you wish to add.
3. Drag the component from the sidebar and drop it onto the canvas where you want it to appear in your app.

## Configuring Components

Each component comes with its own set of configuration options, which can be accessed through the properties panel on the right side of the screen when a component is selected.

- **General Settings**: Customize basic properties like size, alignment, and visibility.
- **Data Binding**: Connect your component to data sources and define how data is displayed or interacted with.
- **Styling**: Adjust the appearance of your component with color, font, and spacing options.

## Commonly Used Components

### Text Component

The text component allows you to add headings, paragraphs, and links to your app. It's essential for providing information and guidance to your users.

### Image Component

Use the image component to add visuals to your app. You can upload images directly or reference them via URL.

### Form Components

Form components like input fields, dropdowns, and buttons are crucial for capturing user input and facilitating interactions.

### Data Table

The data table component displays data in a structured format, allowing users to view and interact with large datasets efficiently.

### Custom Components

For more advanced needs, you can create custom components using HTML/CSS or integrate third-party libraries.

## Tips for Effective Component Use

- **Plan Your Layout**: Before adding components, sketch out a basic layout of your app to ensure a coherent structure.
- **Utilize Containers**: Use container components to group elements and manage layout more effectively.
- **Test Responsiveness**: Regularly preview your app on different devices to ensure components adjust correctly to various screen sizes.
