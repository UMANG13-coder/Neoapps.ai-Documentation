### Building Blocks for Your App: Easy-to-Use Components

> Think of building your app like putting together Lego bricks! NeoApps.AI provides building blocks called "components" to add different features and elements. Here are some popular ones:
- **Text Component**
     - The text component allows you to add headings, paragraphs, and links to your app. It's essential for providing information and guidance to your users.
- **Image Component**
     - Use the image component to add visuals to your app. You can upload images directly or reference them via URL.
- **Form Components**
     - Form components like input fields, dropdowns, and buttons are crucial for capturing user input and facilitating interactions.
- **Data Table**
     - The data table component displays data in a structured format, allowing users to view and interact with large datasets efficiently.
- **Custom Components**
    - For more advanced needs, you can create custom components using HTML/CSS or integrate third-party libraries.

### Building Your App Like a Pro: Top Tips for Using Components

1. **Plan Your App's Look:**
    - Before diving in, imagine how you want your app to look. Sketch a simple layout on paper, like where you want buttons, text, and pictures. This helps make your app organized and easy to use.
2. **Group Things Together:** 
    - Think of your app like a toolbox. Use "container" components like boxes to group related things together. This keeps your app tidy and makes it easier to move things around.
3. **Make Sure Your App Fits All Screens:** 
    - Just like your clothes should fit you well, your app should look good on any phone, tablet, or computer. Check how your components adjust to different screen sizes regularly. This makes sure everyone has a great experience using your app.
