### Building Your App Like a Pro: Top Tips for Using Components

1. **Plan Your App's Look:**
   - Before diving in, imagine how you want your app to look. Sketch a simple layout on paper, like where you want buttons, text, and pictures. This helps make your app organized and easy to use.
2. **Group Things Together:**
   - Think of your app like a toolbox. Use "container" components like boxes to group related things together. This keeps your app tidy and makes it easier to move things around.
3. **Make Sure Your App Fits All Screens:**
   - Just like your clothes should fit you well, your app should look good on any phone, tablet, or computer. Check how your components adjust to different screen sizes regularly. This makes sure everyone has a great experience using your app. -->
