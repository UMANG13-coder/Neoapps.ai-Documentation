> For those who want to push the boundaries of what the [NeoApps.ai](https://neoapps.ai/) can do, advanced configuration options offer a way to incorporate custom code, integrate with external APIs, and manipulate data with sophisticated logic. This guide explores these capabilities, enabling technical users to fully leverage the platform's potential.

### Integrating External APIs

> Integrate your app with external services via APIs for enhanced functionality:

1. **API Setup**: 
    - Define the API endpoints within the app builder and configure the necessary headers and parameters.
2. **Data Fetching**: 
    - Use the API integration to fetch data dynamically and display it within your app components.
3. **Handling Responses**: 
    - Implement logic to handle various API responses, ensuring a smooth user experience.
