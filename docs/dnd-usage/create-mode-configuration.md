# Create Mode Configuration

Create mode in the NeoApps.AI allows users to add new entries to their database, making it a crucial feature for applications that require data input. This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing the create mode for your application.

## Setting Up Create Mode

To enable create mode for a component:

1. Select the component you want to configure in create mode.
2. Navigate to the component's settings panel and find the **Mode** option.
3. Choose **Create** from the dropdown menu to switch the component to create mode.

## Customizing Input Fields

In create mode, you can define which fields users will fill out to add new records:

- **Add Fields**: Drag and drop the desired fields from the component library into your component.
- **Field Properties**: Configure each field's properties, such as field name, data type, and default value.

## Implementing Validation Rules

Validation ensures that the data entered by users meets specific criteria before submission:

1. **Required Fields**: Mark fields as required to prevent form submission without input.
2. **Data Type Validation**: Specify the data type for each field to ensure users enter the correct type of data (e.g., text, numbers, dates).
3. **Custom Validation Rules**: Create custom validation rules using conditional logic for more complex requirements.

## Enhancements for User-Friendly Data Entry

To make data entry easier and more intuitive for users, consider implementing the following enhancements:

- **Field Labels and Descriptions**: Provide clear labels and descriptions for each field.
- **Placeholder Text**: Use placeholder text to give examples or further instructions.
- **Pre-filled Default Values**: Set default values for certain fields to save users time.

## Previewing and Testing

Before finalizing your create mode configuration, it's essential to preview and test the functionality:

1. Use the preview feature in the NeoApps.AI to simulate the user experience.
2. Test the form by entering data, ensuring that all validations work as expected.
