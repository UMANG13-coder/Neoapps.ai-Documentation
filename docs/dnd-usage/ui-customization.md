# UI Customization and Personalization

Customizing the UI of your application is essential for aligning it with your brand identity and enhancing the overall user experience. The NeoApps.AI provides a range of tools and options for personalizing your app's appearance, from color schemes to layout configurations.

## Applying a Color Scheme

Choose a color scheme that reflects your brand or your app's purpose:

1. **Primary and Secondary Colors**: Set primary and secondary colors through the app builder's theme settings to ensure consistency across your app.
2. **Accent Colors**: Use accent colors to highlight important elements such as buttons and links.

## Customizing Fonts

Fonts play a significant role in the readability and personality of your app:

- **Font Family**: Select a font family that complements your app's style and is easy to read.
- **Font Size and Weight**: Adjust font sizes and weights for different text elements to create a clear hierarchy.

## Adjusting Layouts

The layout of your app affects how users interact with your content:

- **Grid System**: Use the app builder's grid system to structure your pages and align elements neatly.
- **Spacing and Margins**: Adjust spacing and margins to ensure that your app doesn't feel cramped or cluttered.

Branding elements such as logos and brand colors make your app instantly recognizable:

- **Logo**: Place your logo prominently in your app's header or splash screen.
- **Brand Colors**: Use your brand's colors for UI elements like headers, footers, and buttons.

## Previewing and Applying Changes

Before finalizing your customizations:

1. **Preview**: Use the app builder's preview feature to see how your changes look on different devices.
2. **Apply Changes**: Once satisfied with the preview, apply the changes to update your app's live version.
